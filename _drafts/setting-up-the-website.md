Having had my domain for a while now, acquiring it
with the intention of using it for multiple purposes,
one of them being a website, till this date I never really put
any effort into making that an actuality.
In an attempt to change this I decided to do something about it.

I am always interested in new technologies, whether they are new
for me or just new in general.
That said I am by no means a front-end developer nor do I believe
I am well versed in UI/UX design.
So I needed something simple,
preferably something that primarily uses text files as a base,
that way I can potentially move everything without having to put
a lot of effort in updating the content.
In the end I decided to host it with GitHub Pages and generating
the static contens using Jekyll.
Jekyll is supported right out of the when using GitHub.
Furthermore, using GitHub Pages I would not have to worry about
the server architecture and would be able to focus on creating
the actual content.
